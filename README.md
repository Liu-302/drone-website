# The Drone Explorer — Project Showcase Website

This is a simple presentation website designed and developed for my **GRP (Group Project)**.  
The project is titled **“The Drone Explorer: Immersive Visualization for UAV Mission Planning.”**

The website serves as an introduction to our team’s UAV visualization project, including the project overview, key features, team members, and advisor information.
